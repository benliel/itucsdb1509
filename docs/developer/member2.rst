      ID serial,

      NAME varchar(80) not null,

      SUPPORTEDTEAM integer not null references clubs(id) on delete cascade on update cascade,

"Sponsors","Penalty" and "Equipments" classes are written by me.::

   .. code-block:: Pyhton

      class Sponsors:
        def __init__(self, name, supportedteam, budget):
        self.name = name
        self.supportedteam = supportedteam
        self.budget = budget

      class Penalty:
        def __init__(self, personname, startdate, enddate, type):
        self.personname = personname
        self.startdate = startdate
        self.enddate = enddate
        self.type = type


      class Equipments:
        def __init__(self, name, manufacturer, price , country):
        self.name = name
        self.manufacturer = manufacturer
        self.price = price
        self.country = country
