      id serial,

      name varchar(80) not null,

      places integer not null references countries(country_id) on delete cascade on update cascade,

      year numeric(4) not null,

      chair varchar(80) not null,

      incomes integer not null,

      expenses integer not null,

"Clubs" and "Money_balances" classes are written by me.::

   .. code-block:: pyhton
      class Clubs:
         def __init__(self, name, place, year, chair, number_of_members, rewardnumber):
            self.name = name
            self.place = place
            self.year = year
            self.chair = chair
            self.number_of_members = number_of_members
            self.rewardnumber = rewardnumber

      class Money_balances:
         def __init__(self, club, incomes, expenses, profit):
            self.club = club
            self.incomes = incomes
            self.expenses = expenses
            self.profit = profit
