   .. code-block:: Pyhton
      class Match:
         def __init__(self, team1, team2, date, time, location):
            self.team1 = team1
            self.team2 = team2
            self.date = date
            self.time = time
            self.location = location

      class Stadium:
         def __init__(self,name,location,capacity,ticket_cost):
            self.name=name
            self.location=location
            self.capacity=capacity
            self.ticket_cost=ticket_cost
